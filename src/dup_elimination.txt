-- duplicate detection:

	select id, name, street, birthday 
	from customer_test orig
	where exists(
		select * 
		from customer_test dup
		where dup.name = orig.name and 
			dup.street=orig.street and
			dup.birthday = orig.birthday and 
			dup.id > orig.id
	) order by id;

-- duplicate elimination: delete from table if there exists a tuple with same information but other id
	delete from customer_test 
	where exists (
		select dup.id 
		from customer_test dup 
		where dup.name = orig.name and
		dup.street = orig.street and
		dup.birthday = orig.birthday and
		dup.id <> orig.id			
	);
